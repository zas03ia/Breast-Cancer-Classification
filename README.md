# Breast-Cancer-Classification
Level - Intermediate
A number of classification models have been trained and tested on the dataset for differentiating between benign and malignant cancer.

Data preprocessing:
1. Loading a dataset (Breast Cancer dataset).
2. Cleaning the dataset by removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
3. Feature engineering by dropping irrelevant (highly corrlelated) columns and encoding labels

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Conducting EDA using visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib.
2. Generating pair plots and correlation heatmaps to understand the relationships and correlations between features.

Model Training and Evaluation:
1. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
2. Standardizing the features.
3. Training multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and SVM) to classify the breast cancer as malignant or benign.
4. Evaluating models using accuracy, confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Comparison and Visualization:
1. Comparing the performance of different models using bar plots to visualize their accuracies
